# namer

This was created so I could curl against an API and get a random name
assigned for me. I hate naming things and the idea of `curl http://url/api/v1`
seemed script-able and easy.

## Usage

- You can `curl` or do a HTTP GET request against `http://url/api/v1` and it'll respond <adjective-noun>.
- You can go to the site `http://url` where you deploy this and it'll give you a <adjective-noun> on the home page.

## Future plans

- `/api/v2/musician` to get an <adjective-musician>
- `/api/v2/scifi` to get an <adjective-scificharacter>
- A way to select options like above from above from the main page
